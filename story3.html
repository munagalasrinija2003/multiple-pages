   <h2><b style="color: rgb(210, 245, 11);">DRSCRIPTION</b></h2>
  <h3><i> <b><p style="color: white;">The stories tell mostly of Mowgli, an Indian boy who is raised by wolves and learns self-sufficiency and wisdom from the jungle animals. The book describes the social life of the wolf pack and, more fancifully, the justice and natural order of life in the jungle. Among the animals whose tales are related in the work are Akela the wolf; Baloo the brown bear; Shere Khan, the boastful Bengal tiger who is Mowgli’s enemy; Tabaqui the jackal, Shere Khan’s obsequious servant; Kaa the python; Bagheera the panther; and Rikki-tikki-tavi the mongoose.</p></b></i></h3>
  <h2><b style="color: rgb(210, 245, 11);">STORY</b></h2>
  <h3><i> <b><p style="color: white;">This is The Jungle Book Story. The story is about a man-baby who was found in the jungle by Bagheera the panther. Bagheera carried the baby to his friends, the wolves. The wolves raised the baby as their own. They named him Mowgli. Mowgli learned to take care of himself in the jungle, but Bagheera the panther was always nearby. He was ever ready to protect little Mowgli. The elephants became his friends. Even the elephant's gruff leader, Colonel Hathi, became Mowgli's friend. It was Colonel Hathi who marched every day at the head of his elephant patrol.Not everyone in the jungle was Mowgli's friend. There was hungry aka the constrictor. His eyes could hypnotize almost everyone And his coils could crush almost anything. Mowgli's most dangerous enemy was Sher Khan, the man-eating tiger Sher Khan was determined to kill the Man-cub. Mowgli before he had a chance to become a man.
    The leader of wolf pack decided there was only one way to keep Mowgli safe. The boy must be taken to the Man
    village they said Bagheera agreed to take him there. Mowgli thought that he and Bagheera were on just another walk in the jungle. Then Bagheera told him where they really were going. Mowgli cried, "Not want to stay in the jungle. Mowgli would not listen to Bagheera and he ran into the jungle alone. He was not alone very long. Within minutes, he was befriended by a happy-go-lucky jungle bear named Baloo. After a while Baloo and Mowgli went swimming in the river
    Baloo floated on his back and Mowgli rode high and dry on the bear's fat tummy Suddenly.Mowgli was whisked up into the treetops. A band of monkeys had reached down from an overhanging limb andhad grabbed him.</p></b></i></h3>

    <h3><i> <b><p align="left"style="color: white;">The monkeys took Mowgli to the ruins of an ancient temple. There the king of the monkeys was eating bananas. He was waiting anxiously to see the captive. "Tell me the secret of Man's red fire?" King Louie said. But Mowgli didn't know how to make fire. He could not tell the king the secret even though his very life depended on it! Fortunately, Balon and Bagheera arrived just as King Louie was getting angry with Mowgli. Quickly they figured out the way to save their friend. Also, read Robin Head Short Story. Baloo disguised himself as a lady monkey, but King Louie was not fooled for long. A wild chase followed, and the whole ancient temple was shaken down. The three friends escaped. After the trouble with King Louie and his band, Bagheera and Baloo tried to tell stowgli that there would be even greater danger in the jungle. Once again Bagheera insisted that
        Mowgli goes to the Man village Nol Noll do not want to go to the Man village Mowgli cried Without another word, he disappeared deep into the jungle.
        Again Bagheera and Baloo searched for Mowgli. But Sher Khan, the tiger, found him first. Sher Khan was furious when Mowgli refused to be afraid of him. He bared his great fangs and leaped! Sher Khan just landed a few inches away from Mowgli He landed with a THUD because Baloo has grabbed the tiger's tail. The big bear had gotten there just in a nick of time! Sher Khan Lashed about trying to get at Baloo, but the bear hung on When Sher Khan could not reach Baloo with his fangs he tried to shake him loose Sher Khan cracked his tail like a whip
        Suddenly a storm came up. A lightning bolt flashed down and set a nearby tree afire. Mowgli saw a way to save Baloo. He knew the one thing Sher Khan feared was fire. Mowgli took a burning branch in his hand and ran towards the tiger. The fire frightened Sher Khan so much that be took off like a rocket! "We'll never see him around these parts again."Bagheera sighed in relief
        Mowgli Bagheera, and Balso promised they never would be parted by anything again. Just then, Mowgli saw something
        he had never seen before Mowgli story took another twist when he saw a girl she was getting water at the pool, just
        de the Man village. That made Bagheera and Baloo very sad. They were sad only for the few moments because they
        knew Mowgli was doing the right thing. They saw him smile as he picked up the water jug. Then they saw him go along
        with the girl to the Man village Mowgli's friends knew that was where Mowgli really belonged. They had brought him
        safely to his new home</p></b></i></h3>

        <h2><b style="color: rgb(210, 245, 11);">MORAL</b></h2>
        <h3><i> <b><p align="left"style="color: white;">The most important life lesson taught by the story “Jungle Book” is not to be a coward. Instead, we need to confidently face our fears and triumph over them. This is shown beautifully in the story of how bravely and confidently Mowgli faces the Tiger - Sher Khan.
