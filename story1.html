    <img  align ="right" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/83/41/ff834172ae066b68fd927025e1fe944f.png" alt=""  height="600" width="450" ><h3><p style="color: rgb(147, 219, 147);">Raya and the Last Dragon is set in Kumandra, a land where people once lived happily, guarded by magical dragons who brought water, prosperity and peace. But then evil monsters called the Druun arrived, bringing nothing but death and destruction, and turning all life to ash and stone. The dragons made a valiant stance to save the last humans, and their combined power wiped out the Druun. But when the smoke cleared, all the dragons were gone and nothing was left save a magical gem and a legend about a lone dragon. In fear, the people split up the land, drawing borders and boundaries. As the years passed, mistrust and animosity grew and the gem had to be hidden away.

        Centuries pass and a kind-hearted king dreams of reuniting the lands. He invites all the nations to reconcile and form Kumandra again. His young daughter, Raya, is trained as a warrior princess. She strikes up a friendship with a girl named Namaari from another kingdom but her trust is soon betrayed. She watches in horror as her beloved father is shot, and the gem she has sworn to protect is broken into pieces. This releases the Druun once again.
        
        As each nation takes a piece of the gem and flees, Raya’s father entrusts his daughter with their piece. He entreats her to unite the kingdoms and flings her into the river just as he himself is turned to stone. Raya spends the next six years searching for the legendary lone dragon.
        
        At last, Raya finds and reanimates the infamous dragon Sisu, who has been sleeping for centuries. Together Raya and Sisu set off to find the other pieces of the gem, vanquish the Druun, and save all those who’ve been turned to stone.</p>
